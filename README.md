# Golden Sneaker
This is the assignment test for web developer intern at Golden Owl. 

## Progress
- Only products that have been saved to database are shown.
- Only HTML, CSS have been implemented (haven't done any functions).

**Note: I did refer a lot to the original CSS file as there are many things that I havenn't experienced.**

## Difficulties
- Still have to search a lot for instructions.
- I don't know how to run the app on others' local with the database in mine, also I havent found a way to upload the database.
- Heroku deployment encountered an error (uninitialized constant Gem::Source (NameError)).
